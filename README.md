## Trading Strategies

The MEV Uniswap Bot implements several trading strategies:

### Sandwich Attacks

Sandwich attacks involve placing two orders around a target transaction. This strategy allows the bot to profit from price changes caused by the target transaction.

### Arbitrage

The bot can identify price discrepancies between different exchanges and execute trades to profit from these differences.

### Front-Running

By observing pending transactions in the mempool, the bot can execute trades before large transactions are confirmed, capitalizing on expected price movements.

### Liquidation

The bot can monitor collateralized loans and execute liquidation trades to profit from under-collateralized positions.

## Security

Security is a top priority for the MEV Uniswap Bot. Here are some measures taken to ensure the safety of your funds:

- **Private Key Management**: Store your private keys securely and never expose them in public repositories.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to avoid being flagged as a bot by exchanges.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Continuously monitor transactions for suspicious activities.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the bot updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
